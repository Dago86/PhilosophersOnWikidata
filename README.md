# PhilosophersOnWikidata
 I searched for philosophers on wikidata, using Google Colab, Python and Sparql!

Work in progress.


WikiData is an open data knowledge base. A very fun thing to do is ask yourself a question, like "How many philosophers are there on WikiData? Or, does WikiData have more philosophers from antiquity or the last twenty years?"
SPARQL (a query language) can be used to extract information.
The site https://query.wikidata.org/ has a search engine that also allows you to export the code in python. And so it doesn't take anything to create some Data Visualization on a Googla Colab sheet!
